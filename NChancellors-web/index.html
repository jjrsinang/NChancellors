			<p>Christmas is just around the corner and Santa's almost done checking his list.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				At 00:00 hours on December 25, 2015,
				Eastern Pacific Time, Santa will depart from
				his workshop at the North Pole with Rudolph on his trusty sleigh to distribute
				all the presents to all the families in the world before Christmas Morning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last Christmas, he narrowly missed his Christmas Morning deadline to distribute the gifts.
				Why? There are billions of families all over the world and only one Santa. So this year, he
				decided to ask some help from you to help him optimize the arrangement of the gifts under the
				Christmas Tree where he could distribute all the gifts to each house of the world as quickly as possible. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Using his Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of the Philippines Los Banos,
				He does know that an optimal arrangement of the gifts is to arrange them in such a way where
				no gift is placed on the north, east, west, south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west of 
				another gift. Since there are so many possible arrangements for this, all he needs you to do is find one
				and you've saved Christmas!
